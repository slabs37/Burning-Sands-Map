# Why is it uploaded
So that others can learn from this map and hopefully fix something or improve in their own Vivify maps.

Most assets were created by me.

Bones are by TANDA [on sketch fab](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/low-poly-bones-asset-pack-b08c4568b2c5464fb1ab40cd871e40dc)

Ship inside was modified by me from the one by gabrielmendesm [on sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/low-poly-ship-command-room-498c4fac709c43b590ef911a1cd2262d)

You can reuse all assets in this project in your own projects.
